<h2> Mixed feelings on robotics</h2>
<b><p> Some people have mixed feeling on robotics/robots</p>
<p> People think robotics are a good thing while other people think it is a bad thing in various ways.<p>
  <hr>
  <p>People don't like competition and especially against a robot, they can do jobs better than a human, faster, and don't need to pay the robots for doing work. People dislike robots because they can steal jobs and how some people fear that they are killing machines that if one goes bad, all the other robots will follow<a href="https://www.livescience.com/18641-reasons-fear-robots.html">"...how armed robots are changing the rules and ways of modern war. If that's not enough to make you a bit leery, consider that Great Britain has established a network of satellites for the purpose of coordinating all those drones and other military assets."</a> Robots are able to have modern technology equip on them that in the future we may have robots fighting in wars against other robots and maybe even people. This might change way on how we fight wars.  </p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.robots.com/articles/benefits-of-robots"> Why robots are good</a> </h2>
    <ul><li>Productivity</li></ul> <p>Robots produce more accurate and high quality work.
Robots rarely make mistakes and are more precise than human workers.
They can produce a greater quantity in a short amount of time.
They can work at a constant speed with no breaks, days off, or holiday time.
They can perform applications with more repeatability than humans.</p>
  <br>
  <ul><li>Safety</li></ul><p>Robots save workers from performing dangerous tasks.
They can work in hazardous conditions, such as poor lighting, toxic chemicals, or tight spaces.
They are capable of lifting heavy loads without injury or tiring.
Robots increase worker safety by preventing accidents since humans are not performing risky jobs.
Workcells provide safety features, separating the worker from harms way. </p>
<br>
<ul><li> Savings</li></ul><p>Robots save time by being able to produce a greater magnitude of products
They also reduce the amount of wasted material used due to their accuracy
Robots save companies money in the long run with quick ROIs (return on investment), fewer worker injuries (reducing or eliminating workerâ€™s comp), and with using less materials.</p>
<br>
<ul><li> And many more!</li></ul><p> There are more benefits on robots like creating more jobs!</p>
