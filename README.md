The Freedom Project is a course-long project where I 
1. Apply the content you are learning in daily lessons to your own creation
2. Learn new content on your own
3. Reflect upon your learning in a blog
Present your product and process

The purpose of this blog is to document my process of learning about my topic "Robotics" and how I can use my knowledge of HTML and CSS to show what I learned

For my for my project, I am addressing the topic of Robotics and creating a website that uses CSS and HTML my site exist to educate other people on some examples of Robotics that are used in the real world. I use CSS and HTML since it's what I just learned this year. 

https://Freedom-Project.gavinlee1.repl.co

I believe this site will help our culture adopt a mentality that CSS and HTML is everywwhere and should be taught more world wide in school with math and science. This will help more students be exposed to computer science and should be taught to be for fluent to the concepts on computer science. 
As technology changes and becoming more advance, we should make people learn more about the recent change in technology that will help our future and society.

As a creator of this site I believe that technology can help industries grow in a positive way, I hope for the best of the future in educatution and jobs and I hope everyone ahs a 2nd plan incase something goes wrong.

Entry 1:

Getting a good layout for my project for robotics using css and html to create a new layout I first used Accordian to put all my information into their own tab

Entry 2:

Getting information on what to write on robotics finding information to use that are available and easy to access so I can easily find them incase I lose them

Entry 3:

Getting pictures and putting information on robotics, Ai, and some random pictures for the “About the author” with CSS and html for the same background to make it look color ful since with just words it looks a little sloppy which I learn that having pictures is a good thing

Entry 4:

Tweaking and changing my site background and layout, changing the accordion to clickable li boxes that can act like nav bar. I removed the accoridan since it is hard to go to differnet parts of the site and it looks like mess on only 1 page

Entry 5:

Made a “about the author” page on the top left corner with CSS so it looks more like an inforamtion site and people are able the "contact" me

Entry 6:

Made all the tabs go to different pages and able to go back to the “home” page making sure all the tabs are clickable and are ideal like how I intended them to be

 Entry 7:

Adding information to “Ai”with html and CSS to make a border design. the more information the better since at first I feel like there is a lack of information

 Entry 8:

Adding more information still and adding some href stuff on all my information so it links to the original sources. I have to give the original source credit since they provided me good information that I took and used

 Entry 9:

Added more info on "AI" page and putting some examples of AI's are better than just giving definitions and added at the end "Learn more" href link that links to the original source that has more information

 Entry 10:

Adding information on “feelings on robotics” and link it to a valid source via href and CSS for font etc since it is a two sided response so I want to add why people feel that way since not everyone has the same opinion

 Entry 11:

Adding more information on “robotics used for military” using html p tags and CSS for pictures/borders since only having the names of the robots aren't enough so adding information on how they use it is better

 Entry 12:

Double checking everything and making sure everything is good
